## Problem statement

Content producers of digital assets like articles, images, audio files find it difficult to sell their products on the web. Often the only way of generating income is to put the content on a free platform and place advertisement. This has several disadvantages like:
- overloaded websites where adds distract from the actual content
- bad UX through slow page load times
- privacy implications through tracking software
- high margin for the platform eats away the profit

If producers would be able to collect small amounts of money through a publishing platform, they could monetize their work. But collecting micro payments in the range of cents or even sub-cents is almost impossible with the current online payment solutions building on top of credit card companies and services like PayPal.

## Solution
lightread offers a solution where no 3rd party payment provider is included in the process. (Micro) payments are done solely through the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) that represents a second layer technology to leverage payment throughput on the Bitcoin network.

With the Lightning Network payments get very cheap and therefore even allow for small transactions down to several Satoshis (0.008 cents, while 1 sat = 1/100'000'000 1 BTC).

Solutions for end-users to use the Lightning wallets in their every-day life will get easier in the future as new engineers and UX specialist optimize the user experience.

On the platform consumers will have the ability to pay content producers for their work or even tip on a donation basis for producers that offer their work for free. Additionally, users can sign up for supporting certain producers on a subscription base (every week / month) allowing the producers to count on a more steady income.
