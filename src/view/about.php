                <h1><strong>Solution</strong></h1>
                <p>lightread offers a solution where no 3rd party payment provider is included in the process. (Micro) payments are done solely through the&nbsp;<a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a>&nbsp;that represents a second layer
                    technology to leverage payment throughput on the Bitcoin network.<br></p>
                <p>With the Lightning Network payments get very cheap and therefore even allow for small transactions down to several Satoshis (0.008 cents, while 1 sat = 1/100'000'000 1 BTC).<br></p>
                <p>Solutions for end-users to use the Lightning wallets in their every-day life will get easier in the future as new engineers and UX specialist optimize the user experience.<br></p>
                <p>On the platform consumers will have the ability to pay content producers for their work or even tip on a donation basis for producers that offer their work for free. Additionally, users can sign up for supporting certain producers on a
                    subscription base (every week / month) allowing the producers to count on a more steady income.<br></p>
