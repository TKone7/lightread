## Lightning Network
The Lightning Network is a protocol that builds a second layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows to make transaction in bitcoin that do not need to be recorded by every participant in the peer-to-per network. This is achieved by so-called 'bi-directional payment channels' which are established between Lightning Network participants. The transactions happen off-chain but the participant can settle their open channels at all times and get their money back on the base chain.
